A new system of reduced equations for the grand potential and the fluid momentum is derived from the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are the quasi-stationary solution to the new system. It is argued that the grand canonical ensemble is the unifying concept for the derivation of models and numerical methods for incompressible fluids, illustrated here with a simulation of a minimal Boltzmann model in a microflow setup.},

Under certain conditions, the cross-sectional shape of micro-slot flames is qualitatively similar to the cross-sectional shape of circular burner port flames produced in an environment where molecular diffusion is the primary transport mechanism. An order of magnitude analysis reveals that, over the range of experimental conditions examined, the behavior of the experimentally observed micro-slot flames is not necessarily diffusion-controlled. A comparison of the experimental data with an accepted theoretical model shows that current theoretical models do not accurately predict the experimentally observed flame heights. A theoretical expression for purely diffusion-controlled micro-slot flame height is developed and compared with experimental micro-slot flame data. The region where this theoretical expression is valid is identified through an examination of the diffusion to buoyancy parameter. A qualitative discussion of micro-slot flame structure is also presented.},

Fuel cells are being commercialized to provide power to buildings like hospitals and schools, to replace batteries in portable electronic devices, and as replacements for internal combustion engines in vehicles. PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cells are lighter, smaller, and more efficient than other types of fuel cell. As a result, over 80\% of fuel cells being produced today are PEM cells. This new edition of Dr. Barbir's groundbreaking book still lays the groundwork for engineers, technicians and students better than any other resource, covering fundamentals of design, electrochemistry, heat and mass transport, as well as providing the context of system design and applications. Yet it now also provides invaluable information on the latest advances in modeling, diagnostics, materials, and components, along with an updated chapter on the evolving applications areas wherein PEM cells are being deployed. Comprehensive guide covers all aspects of PEM fuel cells, from theory and fundamentals to practical applications Provides solutions to heat and water management problems engineers must face when designing and implementing PEM fuel cells in systems Hundreds of original illustrations, real-life engineering examples, and end-of-chapter problems help clarify, contextualize, and aid understanding.},

The analysis shows that the first absolute linear instability of the steady two-dimensional flow is a steady three-dimensional bifurcation at a critical Reynolds number of 748. The critical eigenmode is localized to the primary separation bubble and has a flat roll structure with a spanwise wavelength of 6.9 step heights. The system is further shown to be absolutely stable to two-dimensional perturbations up to a Reynolds number of 1500. Stability spectra and visualizations of the global modes of the system are presented for representative Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract = {In this work we extend the high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method to inviscid low Mach number flows. The method here presented is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the solution at low Mach numbers using both explicit and implicit schemes for the temporal discretization of the compressible Euler equations. The algorithm is based on a classical preconditioning technique that in general entails modifying both the instationary term of the governing equations and the dissipative term of the numerical flux function (full preconditioning approach). In the paper we show that full preconditioning is beneficial for explicit time integration while the implicit scheme turns out to be efficient and accurate using just the modified numerical flux function. Thus the implicit scheme could also be used for time accurate computations. The performance of the method is demonstrated by solving an inviscid flow past a NACA0012 airfoil at different low Mach numbers using various degrees of polynomial approximations. Computations with and without preconditioning are performed on different grid topologies to analyze the influence of the spatial discretization on the accuracy of the DG solutions at low Mach numbers.},

  abstract = {Within realistic combustion devices, physical quantities may change by an order of magnitude over an extremely thin flamefront, while remaining nearly unchanged throughout large areas nearby. Such behaviour dictates the use of adaptive numerical methods. The recently developed local rectangular refinement (LRR) solution-adaptive gridding method produces robust unstructured rectangular grids, utilizes novel multiple-scale finite-difference discretizations, and incorporates a damped modified Newton's method for simultaneously solving systems of governing elliptic PDEs. Here, the LRR method is applied to two axisymmetric laminar flames: a premixed Bunsen flame with one-step chemistry and a diffusion flame employing various complex chemical mechanisms. The Bunsen flame's position is highly dependent upon grid spacing, especially on coarse grids; it stabilizes only with adequate refinement. The diffusion flame results show excellent agreement with experimental data for flame structure, temperature and major species. For both flames, the LRR results on intermediate grids are comparable to those obtained on equivalently refined conventional grids. Solution accuracy on the final LRR grids could not be achieved using conventional grids because the latter exceeded the available computer memory. In general, the LRR method required about half the grid points, half the memory and half the computation time of the solution process on conventional grids.},

Since in our method the transient behaviour is not falsified, temporal accuracy is obtained in a simple manner, without introducing a pseudo-time variable and dual time stepping as required in many other methods designed to tackle the same problem. We will show that with our staggered scheme unsteady fully compressible flows can be computed as accurately as with colocated compressible schemes. In addition, the Mach number can be prescribed to be arbitrarily small, including zero.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the behavior of flows over a backward-facing step geometry for various expansion ratios H/h=1.9423, 2.5 and 3.0. A literature survey was carried out and it was found that the flow shows a strong two-dimensional behavior, on the plane of symmetry, for Reynolds numbers ReD=ρUbD/μ below approximately 400 (Ub=bulk velocity and D=hydraulic diameter). In this Reynolds number range, two-dimensional predictions were carried out to provide information on the general integral properties of backward-facing step flows, on mean velocity distributions and streamlines. Information on characteristic flow patterns is provided for a wide Reynolds number range, 10−4⩽ReD⩽800. In the limiting case of ReD→0, a sequence of Moffatt eddies of decreasing size and intensity is verified to exist in the concave corner also at ReD=1. The irreversible pressure losses are determined for various Reynolds numbers as a function of the expansion ratio. The two-dimensional simulations are known to underpredict the primary reattachment length for Reynolds numbers beyond which the actual flow is observed to be three-dimensional. The spatial evolution of jet-like flows in both the streamwise and the spanwise direction and transition to three-dimensionality were studied at a Reynolds number ReD=648. This three-dimensional analysis with the same geometry and flow conditions as reported by Armaly et al. (1983) reveals the formation of wall jets at the side wall within the separating shear layer. The wall jets formed by the spanwise component of the velocity move towards the symmetry plane of the channel. A self-similar wall-jet profile emerges at different spanwise locations starting with the vicinity of the side wall. These results complement information on backward-facing step flows that is available in the literature.},

The underlying equations are the Navier-Stokes equations for low-Mach-number flows and an additional system of convection-diffusion-reaction equations for the chemical species. Especially in combustion problems the reaction terms are very stiff and nonlinear. This set of equations represents a complicated system of PDEs which is solved usually on parallel computers due to the high numerical cost of memory and computing time. Adaptive methods lead to an important reduction of the computational cost for this type of equations if a good error estimator is available. Our adaptive process is based on an a posteriori error estimate. We use duality arguments in order to control the error in functionals of the solution like, e.g., line-averaged radical concentrations in a stationary flame front. By solving a linearized dual problem, we determine weights multiplying the local residuals in the error estimate. This p...},

As reoophthalmography demonstrated "Isoglaucon" produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract. "Isoglaucon" was prescribed to 20 patients having open-angle-glaucoma, Two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes (of 28) by 9.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. When prescribed regularly "Isoglaucon" raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.20 +/-0.02. The secretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.15. Thus, IOP decrease after "Isoglaucon" is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion. The "isoglucon" instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure, though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked.},

  abstract = {Many industrial applications deal with chemical reactive systems under laminar conditions. Processes like combustion, chemical vapour deposition, coatings, oxidations and many others often times occur in a laminar flow regime, where the reaction rates are controlled by the molecular diffusion of the reactants. Laminar flames are considered nowadays an illustrative example of the combustion phenomenon and its experimental and detailed numerical analysis is an essential part in the modelling of turbulent combustion processes as well as for pollutant formation. The coupling of an academic CFD code (FASTEST-3D) and a chemical kinetics solver (CHEMKIN) has allowed the calculation of several configurations involving combustion under laminar conditions. The results have been compared with the literature and verified against calculations carried out with a commercial code (FLUENT). In the coupling, FASTEST-3D solves the transport equations for mass, momentum, energy and species using the source terms for species and energy provided by CHEMKIN. The information required by the chemistry solver, which is provided by the CFD code, are the species concentrations and the temperature value for each control volume. The transport properties of the different species (diffusion and viscosity) are as well given by CHEMKIN as a function of temperature through its “transport database”. An “operator-splitting” procedure (Strang-Marchuk splitting) has been used for the treatment of source terms in the species and energy transport equations. This procedure consists of solving, in a first step, the mechanical problem for half of the time step, then the chemical source terms are calculated for a full time step and finally the loop is closed by solving the flow equations for the remaining half time step. The influence of critical characteristics like the Courant number or the temporal discretization has been analysed in a 1D configuration (perfectly stirred reactor) and finally some 3D cases have been calculated: · H2 diffusion flame in a micro-combustor · H2 premixed flame (lean mixture) in a Bunsen burner · Cold wall stabilized CH4 premixed flame (stoichiometric mixture) · H2 premixed flame (lean mixture) in the EKT standard burner For the sake of simplicity and to achieve a faster convergence the first three calculations were performed with constant properties (density and viscosity). For the simulation of an H2 premixed flame in the EKT standard burner, all properties were treated as temperature dependant. The simulations showed qualitative and quantitative consistency between the results provided by FASTEST-3D – CHEMKIN, the commercial code, and those available in the literature.},

The liquid phase is considered as incompressible, while the gas phase is treated as compressible in the low Mach number approximation. A single fluid two pressure model is developed and the front tracking method is used to track the interface. Navier-Stokes equations coupled with that of temperature are solved in the whole computational domain. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields are computed yielding a complete description of the dynamics for both phases. We show that our method is much more efficient than the so-called all Mach methods involving a single pressure, since large time steps can be used while retaining time accuracy. The model is first validated on a reference test problem solved using an accurate ALE technique to track the interface. Numerical examples in two space dimensions are next presented. They consist of air bubbles immersed in a closed cavity filled up with liquid water. The forced oscillations of the system consisting of the air bubbles and the liquid water are investigated. They are driven by a heat supply or a thermodynamic pressure difference between the bubbles.},

  abstract = {We present an adaptive algorithm for low Mach number reacting flows with complex chemistry. Our approach uses a form of the low Mach number equations that discretely conserves both mass and energy. The discretization methodology is based on a robust projection formulation that accommodates large density contrasts. The algorithm uses an operator-split treatment of stiff reaction terms and includes effects of differential diffusion. The basic computational approach is embedded in an adaptive projection framework that uses structured hierarchical grids with subcycling in time that preserves the discrete conservation properties of the underlying single-grid algorithm. We present numerical examples illustrating the performance of the method on both premixed and nonpremixed flames.},

  abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics code that solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations was applied to the Taylor-Green vortex problem to examine the code’s ability to accurately simulate the vortex decay and subsequent turbulence. The code, WRLES (Wave Resolving Large-Eddy Simulation), uses explicit central-differencing to compute the spatial derivatives and explicit Low Dispersion Runge-Kutta methods for the temporal discretization. The flow was first studied and characterized using Bogey \& Bailley’s 13-point dispersion relation preserving (DRP) scheme. The kinetic energy dissipation rate, computed both directly and from the enstrophy field, vorticity contours, and the energy spectra are examined. Results are in excellent agreement with a reference solution obtained using a spectral method and provide insight into computations of turbulent flows. In addition the following studies were performed: a comparison of 4th-, 8th-, 12th- and DRP spatial differencing schemes, the effect of the solution filtering on the results, the effect of large-eddy simulation sub-grid scale models, and the effect of high-order discretization of the viscous terms.},

  abstract = {The small scale structure of premixed methane/air flames, stabilized on perforated or porous flat-flame burners has been studied numerically. The two-dimensional combustion equations have been solved, using the vorticity-stream function formulation for the flow field and two different chemistry models: the skeletal mechanism for lean methane combustion and a one-step scheme. The curvature of the flames, predicted by both models is comparable. The range of pore sizes, porosities and mixture velocities, which can be used to create practically undistored flat flames has been determined. It is found that more-dimensional transport effects are negligible in flames, stabilized on the flat-flame burners recently introduced by (Maaren van, 1994) for measuring burning velocities with the Heatflux method. This guarantees that the measurement data are not obscured by small scale distortions and can be compared with ID modeling results.},

At small Rayleigh numbers the flow is dominated by conduction. As the Rayleigh number is increased the flow becomes unstable, first resulting in multicellular secondary flow patterns, and then as the Rayleigh number is further increased becoming turbulent. For this work a range of Rayleigh numbers from 1e3 to 3e5 is considered for a Prandtl number of 0.71. The predicted wavenumber, critical Rayleigh number, and characteristic streamfunctions are compared with experimental work reported in the literature. The effect of COMSOL’s anisotropic and crosswind numerical diffusion values are also evaluated.},

  abstract = {Laminar and turbulent spherically expanding n-heptane flames in mono-sized fuel droplet-mists have been simulated for a range of different overall equivalence ratios and droplet diameters using three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). Flame wrinkling and the evolutions of flame surface area and burned gas volume have been investigated for spherically expanding spray and gaseous premixed flames with the same initial burned gas radius and overall equivalence ratios. It has been found that droplet-induced wrinkling for laminar flame kernels strengthens with increasing overall equivalence ratio and droplet diameter. However, the effects of droplet- induced flame wrinkling are masked by wrinkling induced by fluid motion in turbulent spherically expanding spray flames. The gaseous phase mixture within the flame has been found to have smaller equivalence ratios (predominantly fuel-lean) in comparison to the overall equivalence ratio for globally stoichiometric and fuel-rich droplet cases and this tendency strengthens with increasing droplet diameter. By contrast, it is possible to obtain higher local equivalence ratio values than the overall equivalence ratio in globally fuel-lean spray flames. The presence of droplets in the globally fuel-lean cases enhances the growth of flame surface area under laminar and turbulent conditions. However, for the laminar globally stoichiometric spray flame, flame surface area for small droplets grows faster than the corresponding laminar premixed flame and this tendency is observed also for turbulent globally fuel-rich spray flames. It has been found that the burned gas mass increases for large (small) droplets for overall fuel-lean (fuel-rich) mixtures for flame propagation in droplet-laden mixtures, which is in qualitative agreement with previous experimental findings.},

  abstract = {A numerical analysis is presented to describe the liftoff and blowoff of a diffusion flame in the mixing layer between two parallel streams of fuel (mainly methane diluted with nitrogen) and air emerging from porous walls. The analysis, which takes into account the effects of thermal expansion, assumes a one-step overall Arrhenius reaction, where the activation energy E is allowed to vary to reproduce the variations of the planar flame propagation velocity with the equivalence ratio. First, we describe the steady flame-front structure when stabilized close to the porous wall (attached flame regime). Then, we analyze the case where the flame front is located far away from the porous wall, at a distance xf′ such that, upstream of the flame front, the mixing layer has a self-similar structure (lifted flame regime). For steady lifted flames, the results, given here in the case when the fuel and air streams are injected with the same velocity, relate Uf′/SL, the front velocity (relative to the upstream flow) measured with the planar stoichiometric flame velocity, with the Damköhler number Dm=(δm/δL)2, based on the thickness, δm, of the nonreacting mixing layer at the flame-front position and the laminar flame thickness, δL. For large values of Dm, the results, presented here for a wide range of dilutions of the fuel stream, provide values of the front propagation velocity that are in good agreement with previous experimental results, yielding well-defined conditions for blowoff. The calculated flame-front velocity can also be used to describe the transient flame-front dynamics after ignition by an external energy source.},

  abstract = {We present a higher-order cut cell immersed boundary method (IBM) for the simulation of high Mach number flows. As a novelty on a cut cell grid, we evaluate an adaptive local time stepping (LTS) scheme in combination with an artificial viscosity–based shock-capturing approach. The cut cell grid is optimized by a nonintrusive cell agglomeration strategy in order to avoid problems with small or ill-shaped cut cells. Our approach is based on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the compressible Euler equations, where the immersed boundary is implicitly defined by the zero isocontour of a level set function. In flow configurations with high Mach numbers, a numerical shock-capturing mechanism is crucial in order to prevent unphysical oscillations of the polynomial approximation in the vicinity of shocks. We achieve this by means of a viscous smoothing where the artificial viscosity follows from a modal decay sensor that has been adapted to the IBM. The problem of the severe time step restriction caused by the additional second-order diffusive term and small nonagglomerated cut cells is addressed by using an adaptive LTS algorithm. The robustness, stability, and accuracy of our approach are verified for several common test cases. Moreover, the results show that our approach lowers the computational costs drastically, especially for unsteady IBM problems with complex geometries.},

  abstract = {The implementation of a two-phase flow model, developed at SINTEF Energy Research and relying on the level-set method, was extended through the discretization and implementation of an advection-diffusion equation for temperature and a Boussinesq coupling between the temperature and velocity fields. In two-phase flow, both the continuum surface force method and the ghost-fluid method was employed for handling jumps at the interface. Results from simulated cases indicated that the implementation for both single- and two-phase flow with the ghost-fluid method was correct, with second- and first-order convergence, respectively.Also, a model for phase transition was implemented to allow for vaporization and condensation mass transport between the phases. Results from simulated one-dimensional cases indicated that the implementation of this model was correct in one dimension, with first-order convergence. These results from one dimension and the qualitatively correct results from two dimensions gave reason to believe that the implementation was correct also in two dimensions.Through the introduction of heat-transport physics in the implementation of the two-phase flow model, this implementation has been developed in direction of performing more detailed simulations that are relevant for natural gas liquefaction processes.},

The two-dimensional combustion equations have been solved, using the vorticity-stream function formulation for the flow field and two different chemistry models: the skeletal mechanism for lean methane combustion and a one-step scheme. The curvature of the flames, predicted by both models is comparable. The range of pore sizes, porosities and mixture velocities, which can be used to create practically undistored flat flames has been determined. It is found that more-dimensional transport effects are negligible in flames, stabilized on the flat-flame burners recently introduced by (Maaren van, 1994) for measuring burning velocities with the Heatflux method. This guarantees that the measurement data are not obscured by small scale distortions and can be compared with ID modeling results.},

  abstract = {This thesis describes a numerical method for computational fluid dynamics. Special attention is paid to low­Mach number flows.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; The spatial discretization is a discontinuous Galerkin method, based on modal basis functions. The convection is discretized with the local Lax­Friedrichs flux. The diffusion in the enthalpy equation is discretized with the symmetric interior penalty method, which is generalized in a straightforward manner for the viscous stress in the momentum equation. The numerical method does not deviate fundamentally from previous literature.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; The temporal derivatives in the enthalpy and momentum equations are dis­ cretized with a second­order backward finite difference method. An algorithmic pressure correction scheme is used decouple the momentum and the continuity equations, giving rise to explicit artificial boundary conditions. If the pressure and\&lt;br/\&gt;the momentum are discretized with an equal­order polynomial space, then the pres­sure equation is stabilized with an extra penalty term to suppress the discontinuities in the solution, as explained in chapter 2.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; Using a time­splitting method is far more difficult when the flow is compressible, due the variable density. Low­Mach number flows also do not lend themselves well to solving the coupled transport equations, because the density is a function of the enthalpy, not the pressure. This differs from high­Mach number flows, where one can solve a transport equation for the density. Chapter 4 describes in great detail how a non­constant density can be incorporated into a time­splitting scheme for low­Mach number flows.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; Chapter 4 also discusses the best form of the enthalpy transport equation to solve (primitive or conservative), and for which variable (primitive or conserved). This question arises in low­Mach number flows, because the density is a function of the temperature. Here the conservative transport equation is solved for the specific enthalpy.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; The main difficulty with this approach is that the temporal enthalpy derivative is nonlinear due to the variable density. This can be addressed with an easily implemented adjustment of the finite difference scheme (‘method \#2’ in sections 4.3–4.4). The resulting discretization displays second­order temporal accuracy (as measured in the spatial \&amp;\#x1d43f;2 norm) for the enthalpy and the mass flux, without having to iterate within a time step.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; Furthermore, the enthalpy transport equation needs to be stabilized with a sim­ple change of variables, in which the specific enthalpy is ‘offset’ by a constant. Though it may be counter­intuitive, the enthalpy offset is critical to the stability and the accuracy of the temporal discretization. This would also be true if one were to solve for the volumetric enthalpy, because the enthalpy offset determines whether there is a one­to­one mapping between the volumetric enthalpy and the density.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt; The spatial and temporal discretizations and their implementations are exten­sively verified and validated with the test cases at the end of the chapters. In particular, sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 4.5.1 feature exhaustive tests with manufac­tured solutions with nontrivial fluid properties. Sections 2.7, 3.4, and 4.5.2 contain validations for laminar flows. Chapter 5 also shows simulations of turbulent flows.\&lt;br/\&gt;},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, there has been much development in discontinuous Galerkin methods for incompressible flows and for compressible flows with a positive Mach number, but almost no attention has been paid to variable-density flows at low speeds. This paper presents a pressure-based discontinuous Galerkin method for flow in the low-Mach number limit. We use a variable-density pressure correction method, which is simplified by solving for the mass flux instead of the velocity. The fluid properties do not depend significantly on the pressure, but may vary strongly in space and time as a function of the temperature. We pay particular attention to the temporal discretization of the enthalpy equation, and show that the specific enthalpy needs to be ‘offset’ with a constant in order for the temporal finite difference method to be stable. We also show how one can solve for the specific enthalpy from the conservative enthalpy transport equation without needing a predictor step for the density. These findings do not depend on the spatial discretization. A series of manufactured solutions with variable fluid properties demonstrate full second-order temporal accuracy, without iterating the transport equations within a time step. We also simulate a Von Kármán vortex street in the wake of a heated circular cylinder, and show good agreement between our numerical results and experimental data.},

Numerical solution was achieved with an implementation of the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure velocity coupling of variables, and the solution of the tridiagonal systems of algebraic equations was accomplished by a parallelized ADI scheme based on the Thomas algorithm. Implementation of the numerical solution was done with an in-house C code which combined OMP and CUDA technologies for computations based on CPU and GPU, respectively. Exponential structured grids were employed in the wall vicinity to capture the turbulence behavior. Results indicate that similar profiles for velocity, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation were found. Several CUDA grids were tested and their performances measured over two GPUs: GTX 680 and GTX TITAN. Considerable speedup was achieved by the GPUs over the CPU schemes even without the use of the device shared memory which was not explored due to the nature of the algorithm. © 2017, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.}

  abstract = {A theoretical framework is established to study the effect of flow strain rate on counterflow diffusion flames for general fluids over the entire thermodynamic regime. The formulation accommodates fundamental thermodynamics and transport theories, along with detailed chemical mechanisms. Both steady and unsteady burning branches of a complete flame-response curve (the S-curve) are considered. An improved two-point flame-controlling continuation method is employed to solve the singularity problem at the turning points on the S-curve. As a specific example, oxygen/hydrogen flames are systematically investigated over a pressure range of 0.5–200atm. The strain rate is varied from 102 to 108s−1. Two different inlet temperatures for oxygen (120 and 300K) and hydrogen (20 and 300K) are treated to explore flame behaviors at the ideal-gas and cryogenic-liquid states. General flame similarities (in terms of flame temperature, flame thickness, species concentrations, reaction rates, and heat release rate) are developed in a normalized strain-rate space (a/aext) for the entire range of pressures under consideration. Quantitative mapping of flame properties from one pressure to another is obtained. In addition, an analytical model is developed to refine and elucidate a previously established relationship between the heat release rate and pressure and strain rate in the form of q̇∼p0.534a. The heat release rate, when normalized with respect to p0.534aext, correlates well with the normalized strain rate (a/aext). Both numerical and analytical results show that the extinction strain rate is approximately proportional to pressure; this allows for a priori mapping of flame solutions between different pressure conditions. This in turn will significantly improve the computational efficiency of combustion modeling using tabulated chemistry, including the flamelet, FGM, and FPI models. Cryogenic inlet temperature affects only the flame location, without discernibly modifying the flame structures, which suggests that the ideal-gas flame solutions can be used for flame tabulation.},

  abstract = {A front-tracking method is developed for the direct numerical simulation of evaporation process in a liquid-gas multiphase system. One-field formulation is used to solve the flow, energy and species equations in the framework of the front tracking method, with suitable jump conditions at the interface. Both phases are assumed to be incompressible; however, the divergence-free velocity field condition is modified to account for the phase-change/mass-transfer at the interface. Both temperature and species gradient driven evaporation/phase-change processes are simulated. For the species gradient driven phase change process, the Clausius-Clapeyron equilibrium relation is used to find the vapor mass fraction and subsequently the evaporation mass flux at the interface. A number of benchmark cases are first studied to validate the implementation. The numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions for all the studied cases. The methods are then applied to study the evaporation of a static as well as a single and two droplets systems falling in the gravitational field. The methods are demonstrated to be grid convergent and the mass is globally conserved during the phase change process for both the static and moving droplet cases.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed description and verification of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG) for the multi-component chemically reacting compressible Navier-Stokes equations that retains the desirable properties of DG, namely discrete conservation and high-order accuracy in smooth regions of the flow. Pressure equilibrium between adjacent elements is maintained through the consistent evaluation of the thermodynamics model and the resulting weak form, as well as the proper choice of nodal basis. As such, the discretization does not generate unphysical pressure oscillations in smooth regions of the flow or at material interfaces where the temperature is continuous. Additionally, we present an hp-adaptive DG method for solving systems of ordinary differential equations, DGODE, which is used to resolve the temporal evolution of the species concentrations due to stiff chemical reactions. The coupled solver is applied to several challenging test problems including multi-component shocked flows as well as chemically reacting detonations, deflagrations, and shear flows with detailed kinetics. We demonstrate that the discretization does not produce unphysical pressure oscillations and, when applicable, we verify that it maintains discrete conservation. The solver is also shown to reproduce the expected temperature and species profiles throughout a detonation as well as the expected two-dimensional cellular detonation structure. We also demonstrate that the solver can produce accurate, high-order, approximations of temperature and species profiles without artificial stabilization for the case of a one-dimensional pre-mixed flame. Finally, high-order solutions of two- and three-dimensional multi-component chemically reacting shear flows, computed without any additional stabilization, are presented.},

By selecting the generalized minimum residual method as the linear smoother for the multigrid algorithm, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to investigate the behavior and efficiency of the multigrid solver in solving the linearized systems, by choosing several preconditioners for the Krylov subspace method. It is shown that the overall efficiency of the damped Newton multigrid algorithm is highly related to the quality of the preconditioner chosen and the number of smoothing steps done on each level. ILU preconditioners based on the Jacobian pattern are found to be robust and provide efficient smoothing but at an expensive cost of storage. It is also demonstrated that the technique of mesh sequencing and multilevel correction scheme provides significant CPU saving for fine grid calculations by limiting the growth of the Krylov iterations.},

Major difficulties arise from a number of specific physical properties of combustion systems, which are extremely difficult to represent by discrete numerical approximations. This article explains three key problem areas that are relevant to premixed turbulent combustion and that are related to singular limit regimes of the underlying reactive flow equations. These problem areas are the low Mach number singularity, the deflagration and detonation discontinuity limits, and some issues arising from numerical integration of stiff and rapid chemical reaction equations. For each problem area we summarize the underlying physical processes and the relevant mathematical description, explain the associated numerical problems, and provide brief descriptions of numerical strategies to overcome them.

This semi-implicit scheme involves multiple pressure variables, large scale differencing and averaging procedures that are discretized versions of standard operations in multiple scales asymptotic analysis. Advection and acoustic wave propagation are discretized explicitly and upwind and only one scalar elliptic equation is to be solved implicitly at each time step. This equation is a pressure correction equation for incompressible flows when the Mach number is zero. In the low Mach number limit, the time step is restricted by a Courant number based essentially on the maximum flow velocity. For moderate and large Mach numbers the scheme reduces to the underlying explicit higher order shock capturing algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this paper, five different algorithms are presented for the simulation of low Mach flows with large temperature variations, based on second-order central-difference or fourth-order compact spatial discretization and a pressure projection-type method. A semi-implicit three-step Runge–Kutta/Crank–Nicolson or second-order iterative scheme is used for time integration. The different algorithms solve the coupled set of governing scalar equations in a decoupled segregate manner. In the first algorithm, a temperature equation is solved and density is calculated from the equation of state, while the second algorithm advances the density using the differential form of the equation of state. The third algorithm solves the continuity equation and the fourth algorithm solves both the continuity and enthalpy equation in conservative form. An iterative decoupled algorithm is also proposed, which allows the computation of the fully coupled solution. All five algorithms solve the momentum equation in conservative form and use a constant- or variable-coefficient Poisson equation for the pressure. The efficiency of the fourth-order compact scheme and the performances of the decoupling algorithms are demonstrated in three flow problems with large temperature variations: non-Boussinesq natural convection, channel flow instability, flame–vortex interaction.

Furthermore, we introduce a splitting type approach of coupling fluid and rigid body solver and point out the explicit calculation of hydrodynamic forces using hierarchical moment fitting. To verify our method we compare our new approach to a range of numerical benchmarks taken from the literature. At first we compare our method with calculations using a body fitted grid. Thereafter we will focus on representing boundaries with fixed motion to point out the accuracy and flexibility of our IBM. Afterwards we show results of full coupled test cases in which the explicit coupling approach and the calculation of forces mentioned above come into play. It can be shown, that with our method we can get similar results by decreasing the number of total unknowns significantly, which is the main advantage of the proposed scheme.}

  abstract = {This PhD thesis contains three major aspects: (1) the BoSSS software framework (or simply BoSSS code) itself, (2) an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver that is based on the BoSSS framework and finally (3) the development of the Extended Discontinuous Galerkin (XDG) method. One major result is the BoSSS software framework (or simply BoSSS code) itself. Its core aspects are discussed form both, software engineering and mathematical point of view. The software design itself features some novel aspects. Up to our knowledge, it is the first time someone implemented a large-scale, MPI-parallel CFD-application in the C\# -language. The implemented BoSSS software library is a general tool for for the discretization of a systems of balance equations by means of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. On the foundation of this software library, a solver for incompressible single-phase problems, based on the projection method, was developed. Since the solution of the Poisson equation proofed to be the dominating operation in the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver, the Conjugate Gradient solver was ported to GPU (Graphics processing Unit), yielding an acceleration factor in the range of 5 to 20 in comparison to CPU. By the XDG method, it becomes possible to treat equations with singularities, i.e. jumps and kinks in the the solution, without regularizing  these singularities (i.e. without ``smearing them'' out). The final aim of the XDG method is the treatment of immiscible multiphase flows. Since in single-phase settings it is commonly accepted that fractional-step - approaches like the Projection method offer better performance than `overall'-schemes, which assemble a large nonlinear, differential-algebraic system from the Navier-Stokes equations, it seems beneficial to extend these ideas to multiphase flows. Therefor, solvers for singular scalar equations were developed: for the Poisson equation with jump, as a proptotype for elliptic steady-state problems and for the instationary Heat equation as an example for a time-dependent equation with moving interface.},

The fluid interface is represented by a level set, and the DG approximation space is adapted such that jumps and kinks in pressure and velocity fields can be approximated sharply. This adaption of the original DG space, which can be performed ‘on-the-fly’ for arbitrary interface shapes, is referred to as extended discontinuous Galerkin. By combining this ansatz with a special quadrature technique, one can regain spectral convergence properties for low-regularity solutions, which is demonstrated by numerical examples. This work focuses on the aspects of spatial discretization, and special emphasis is devoted on how to overcome problems related to quadrature, small cut cells, and condition number of linear systems. Temporal discretization will be discussed in future works. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The algorithm is based on a predictor-corrector time integration scheme that employs a projection method for the momentum equation. A constant-coefficient Poisson equation is solved for the pressure following both the predictor and corrector steps to fully satisfy the continuity equation at each time step. Spatial discretization is performed on a collocated grid system that offers computational simplicity and straightforward extension to curvilinear coordinate systems. To avoid the pressure odd-even decoupling that is typically encountered in such grids, a flux interpolation technique is introduced for the equations governing variable density flows. An important characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that it can be applied to flows in both open and closed domains. Its robustness and accuracy are illustrated with a series of numerical experiments. In particular, we present simulations of non-isothermal, turbulent channel flow as well as simulations of a premixed flame-vortex interaction.},

  abstract = {The vectoring of an incompressible, two-dimensional jet in a co-flowing stream is  investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. The control input used to  stimulate jet vectoring is accomplished through distributed suction from blunt-faced  lips at the exit of the jet. The thrust vector methodology is based on suppression  of global instabilities in the wake-shear layers formed between the co-flow and the  jet. Once a critical suction volume flux needed to suppress these global instabilities  is exceeded, local flow control can be realized through varying the distribution of  suction across the base of the jet lips. It is found that the critical suction flux scales  primarily with the ambient co-flow, not with the jet speed, and that lift-to-thrust  ratios exceeding 15\% can be realized. The effects of jet Reynolds number, jet-to- ambient velocity ratio, boundary-layer thickness, and geometric parameters on various  performance characteristics are examined. It is also shown that the asymmetric flow  control approach used for vectoring the jet can also be implemented in a symmetric  configuration to enhance jet spreading. Significant increases in jet spreading can be  realized when the symmetrically applied suction flux is sufficient to stimulate the  sinuous mode of instability of the jet such that energetic apping motion ensues.},

When the resulting maximum temperature is plotted in terms of the Damköhler number (which is inversely proportional to the flow velocity) the characteristic S curve emerges from the analysis, with segments from the curve resulting from: 1.(a) A nearly frozen ignition regime where the temperature and concentrations deviations from its frozen flow values are small. The lower branch and bend of the S curve is covered by this regime.2.(b) A partial burning regime, where both reactants cross the reaction zone toward regions of frozen flow. This regime is unstable.3.(c) A premixed flame regime where only one of the reactants leaks through the reaction zone, which then separates a region of frozen flow from a region of near-equilibrium.4.(d) A near-equilibrium diffusion controlled regime, covering the upper branch of the S curve, with a thin reaction zone separating two regions of equilibrium flow.

  abstract = {Three-dimensional n-heptane spray flames in a swirl combustor are investigated by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS) to provide insight into realistic spray evaporation and combustion as well as relevant modeling issues. The variable-density, low-Mach number Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a fully conservative and kinetic energy conserving finite difference scheme in cylindrical coordinates. Dispersed droplets are tracked in a Lagrangian framework. Droplet evaporation is described by an equilibrium model. Gas combustion is represented using an adaptive one-step irreversible reaction. Two different cases are studied: a lean case that resembles a lean direct injection combustion, and a rich case that represents the primary combustion region of a rich-burn/quick-quench/lean-burn combustor. The results suggest that premixed combustion contribute more than 70\% to the total heat release rate, although diffusion flame have volumetrically a higher contribution. The conditional mean scalar dissipation rate is shown to be strongly influenced, especially in the rich case. The conditional mean evaporation rate increases almost linearly with mixture fraction in the lean case, but shows a more complex behavior in the rich case. The probability density functions (PDF) of mixture fraction in spray combustion are shown to be quite complex. To model this behavior, the formulation of the PDF in a transformed mixture fraction space is proposed and demonstrated to predict the DNS data reasonably well.},

  abstract = {Atomization and evaporation processes have extensively existed in a variety of scientific and engineering applications, such as, rain formation, spray cooling, and spray combustion in propulsion devices. In spray combustion, atomization and evaporation processes govern the resultant liquid droplet characteristics, which strongly affect the combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. However, atomization and evaporation are very complicated processes that involve convoluted interfaces as well as the breakup and coalescence of liquid masses, together with mass and heat transfers on the interface. Deep insights into atomization and evaporation put a significant challenge to the measuring techniques due to the harsh conditions and multi-scale nature of the problem within the apparatus. With the developments of computational algorithm and computer capacity, detailed numerical simulation of the atomization and evaporation processes has been a promising tool to explore the underlying physics. Level set method is such an interface capturing method, and tremendous progresses have been made for detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation over the past few decades. In this article, we attempt to review the recent progresses in the development of the level set method and its applications to atomization and evaporation. Firstly, the fundamentals of the level set method are introduced and recent advances in improving the mass conservation are emphasized. Secondly, numerical issues for detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation are summarized and the strategies for treating them are highlighted. We then review the state-of-the-art progresses in detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation with the level set method. The challenges and future prospects are summarized in the end.},

Compared to aerodynamic flow applications, in which DG methods have been successfully employed, DG simulations of chemically reacting flows introduce challenges that arise from flow unsteadiness, combustion, heat release, compressibility effects, shocks, and variations in thermodynamic properties. To address these challenges, algorithms are developed, including an entropy-bounded DG method, an entropy-residual shock indicator, and a new formulation of artificial viscosity. The performance and capabilities of the resulting DG method are demonstrated in several relevant applications, including shock/bubble interaction, turbulent combustion, and detonation. It is concluded that the developed DG method shows promising performance in application to multicomponent reacting flows. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to enable the application of DG methods to more complex reacting flows.},

  abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for the simulation of unsteady viscous stratified compressible flows. The advantage of the method is its capability to deal with a broad range of subsonic Mach numbers, including nearly incompressible flows, with a single modelling, based on the fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The method is second-order accurate both in space and time. To remove the stiffness of the numerical problem due to the large disparity between the flow and the acoustic wave speeds at low Mach number, an approximate Newton method, based on artificial compressibility, is used. After a detailed description of the method, the accuracy of the algorithm is checked by computing compressible and incompressible benchmark test cases. Results of flows over a backward facing step with or without stratification effects for a Reynolds number of 800 are compared with the steady solution of incompressible methods. The computation of a compressible natural convection allows to evaluate the accuracy of the method for flow including significant compressibility effects, whereas numerical results of a Poiseuille–Bénard channel flow for a Reynolds number of 10 demonstrate the efficiency of the present algorithm to compute unsteady flows.},

Background information from corresponding laminar flow problems, relevant turbulent combustion modelling approaches, and the ignition of turbulent sprays are included. For both autoignition and spark ignition, examination of the reaction zones in mixture fraction space is revealing. We review experimental and numerical data on the stochastic nature of the emergence of autoignition kernels and of the creation of kernels and subsequent flame establishment following spark ignition, aiming to reveal the particular facet of the turbulence causing the stochasticity. In contrast to fullyfledged turbulent combustion where the effects of turbulence on the reaction are reasonably wellestablished, at least qualitatively, here the turbulence can cause trends that are not straightforward.},

  abstract = {Gaseous fuel is injected at a constant rate M from the bottom of a narrow insulated chamber and oxidant diffuses from the top. The object is to determine the response curve, i.e. the unburnt fuel fraction R as a function of M for fixed Damköhler number (representing either the constant chamber pressure or the chamber's length). The conclusions we draw are based on activation-energy asymptotics. Explicit response curves are obtained over the whole range of D. Two critical values Da, D0 are uncovered and determined explicitly. If D {$<$} Da the fuel will not burn: R = 1 (extinguished state). If Da {$<$} D {$<$} D0 a closed curve, called an isola, is also a possible response; its base lies on R = 0 (complete burning) and its upper part corresponds to a partial burning of fuel. If D {$>$} D0 the response is 5-shaped: the top of the curve lies on R = 1 and extends to M → ∞; the bottom lies on R = 0 and persists however small M becomes. The isola has two extinction points, corresponding to the fuel being supplied too slowly or too fast to a flame at the bottom or top of the chamber. The S has just the latter, but also has an ignition point; as M is decreased through the corresponding value the flame suddenly appears. The asymptotic analysis completes the inadequate picture obtained previously by numerical methods. It spans the whole range of parameter values and enables explicit formulas to be written for the ignition and extinction points.},

Given its importance in these diverse areas, the process of convection has been the focus of many research studies over the past two centuries. However, much less research has been conducted on how the presence of an obstruction in the flow can impact convection. In this work, we find that the presence of an obstruction can greatly affect convection. We note occurrences where the presence of an obstruction yields similar behavior to flow without an obstruction. Additionally, we find cases with markedly different features in comparison to their counterpart without an obstruction– notably, exhibiting long-term periodic behavior instead of achieving a constant steady-state, or the formation of convection cells versus an absence of them.},

  abstract = {A variety of liquid droplet evaporation models, including both classical equilibrium and non-equilibrium Langmuir–Knudsen formulations, are evaluated through comparisons with experiments with particular emphasis on computationally efficient procedures for gas–liquid flow simulations. The models considered are those used in droplet laden flow calculations such as direct numerical simulations for which large numbers of individual (isolated) droplet solutions are obtained. Diameter and temperature evolution predictions are made for single-component droplets of benzene, decane, heptane, hexane and water with relatively large initial sizes ∼1mm vaporizing in convective air flows. All of the models perform nearly identically for low evaporation rates at gas temperatures significantly lower than the boiling temperature. For gas temperatures at and above the boiling point, large deviations are found between the various model predictions. The simulated results reveal that non-equilibrium effects become significant when the initial droplet diameter is {$<$}50μm and that these effects are enhanced with increasing slip velocity. It is additionally observed that constant properties can be used throughout each simulation if both the gas and vapor values are calculated at either the wet-bulb or boiling temperature. The models based on the Langmuir–Knudsen law and a corrected (for evaporation effects) analytical heat transfer expression derived from the quasi-steady gas phase assumption are shown to agree most favorably with a wide variety of experimental results. Since the experimental droplet sizes are all much larger than the limit for non-equilibrium effects to be important, for these conditions the most crucial aspect of the current Langmuir–Knudsen models is the corrected analytical form for the heat transfer expression as compared to empirical relations used in the remaining models.},

  abstract = {A novel and efficient algorithm is presented in this paper to deal with DNS of turbulent reacting flows under the low-Mach-number assumption, with detailed chemistry and a quasi-spectral accuracy. The temporal integration of the equations relies on an operatingsplit strategy, where chemical reactions are solved implicitly with a stiff solver and the convection–diffusion operators are solved with a Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev method. The spatial discretisation is performed with high-order compact schemes, and a FFT based constant-coefficient spectral solver is employed to solve a variable-coefficient Poisson equation. The numerical implementation takes advantage of the 2DECOMP\&FFT libraries developed by [1], which are based on a pencil decomposition method of the domain and are proven to be computationally very efficient. An enhanced pressure-correction method is proposed to speed up the achievement of machine precision accuracy. It is demonstrated that a second-order accuracy is reached in time, while the spatial accuracy ranges from fourth-order to sixth-order depending on the set of imposed boundary conditions. The software developed to implement the present algorithm is called HOLOMAC, and its numerical efficiency opens the way to deal with DNS of reacting flows to understand complex turbulent and chemical phenomena in flames.},

  abstract = {A multiple-time scale, single-space scale asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals how the heat-release rate and heat conduction affect the zeroth-order global thermodynamic pressure, the divergence of velocity and the material change of density at low-Mach-numbers. The asymptotic analysis identifies the acoustic time change of the heat-release rate as the dominant source of sound in low-Mach-number flow. The viscous and buoyancy forces enter the computation of the second-order ‘incompressible’ pressure in low-Mach-number flow in a similar way as they enter the pressure computation in incompressible flow, except for a nonzero velocity-divergence constraint. If the flow equations are averaged over an acoustic wave period, the averaged velocity tensor describes the net acoustic effect on the averaged flow field. Removing acoustics from the equations altogether leads to the low-Mach-number equations, which allow for large temperature and density changes as opposed to the Boussinesq equations.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the establishment of a large flat diffusion flame in the counter-flow regime of opposed jets of two gaseous reactants could very considerably extend the range of applicability of flame-kinetics studies by structure analysis. Suitable flames are stabilized and their characteristics and behaviour described. The flow patterns, spectrum, refractive index fields, temperature distributions and gas composition at a few selected points are studied for ethylene flames by methods including the use of thermocouples, sodium line reversal, illuminated particle tracks, interferometry and gas chromatography. The aerodynamic and thermal structures are analyzed to yield the distribution of the rate of heat release per unit volume. The following are among the conclusions: two stagnation points and two planes which particles cannot cross occur when the centres of the reaction and aerodynamic systems are made to coincide-this can be prevented by displacing the plane of stoichiometry from that of aerodynamic symmetry; the radial component of flow velocity is proportional to radial distance in the central parts. Isotherms are parallel to each other and to the flame, away from the edges, but maximum temperatures occur at the periphery, at least for some flames. The heat release profile shows regions where small amounts of heat are absorbed; C2H6 and H2 appear on the oxidant side of the flame. The most significant observation is that the zone of heat release is about ten times wider than would be expected of the equivalent pre-mixed flame and this makes the method applicable to the study of faster flame reactions.},

While it is widely used in optimization, including large-scale optimization via truncated-Newton approaches, its implementation in general inexact Newton methods for systems of nonlinear equations can be problematic. In this paper, we first outline a very general dogleg method suitable for the general inexact Newton context and provide a global convergence analysis for it. We then discuss certain issues that may arise with the standard dogleg implementational strategy and propose modified strategies that address them. Newton-Krylov methods have provided important motivation for this work, and we conclude with a report on numerical experiments involving a Newton-GMRES dogleg method applied to benchmark CFD problems.}

The code runs on distributed memory parallel machines, with several load balancing algorithms. We show applications to diffusion hydrogen/air and premixed methane/air flames. Multigrid acceleration has been obtained for sufficiently fine grids.},

  abstract = {We present a fourth-order finite-volume algorithm in space and time for low Mach number reacting flow with detailed kinetics and transport. Our temporal integration scheme is based on a multi-implicit spectral deferred correction (MISDC) strategy that iteratively couples advection, diffusion, and reactions evolving subject to a constraint. Our new approach overcomes a stability limitation of our previous second-order method encountered when trying to incorporate higher-order polynomial representations of the solution in time to increase accuracy. We have developed a new iterative scheme that naturally fits within our MISDC framework that allows us to simultaneously conserve mass and energy while satisfying on the equation of state. We analyse the conditions for which the iterative schemes are guaranteed to converge to the fixed point solution. We present numerical examples illustrating the performance of the new method on premixed hydrogen, methane, and dimethyl ether flames.},

  abstract = {A C1-chain mechanism for methane flames is systematically reduced through steady-state and partial-equilibrium assumptions to the three-step mechanism I CH4+O2→CO+H2+H2O, II CO+H2O⇄CO2+H2, III O2+2H2→2H2O, with rates that still contain the kinetic information of the elementary mechanism. A basic asymptotic structure for premixed stoichiometric methane flames is derived from this mechanism for pressures and temperatures sufficiently large that the Damköhler numbers of the second and third reactions are expected to be large. It turns out that the first reaction occurs in a thin fuel-consumption layer embedded between a chemically inert upstream layer and a broader (but still asymptotically thin) downstream layer where H2 and CO are oxidized. At the leading edge of the oxidation layer there is a nonequilibrium layer of the second reaction which tends to equilibrium downstream. The fuel-consumption layer is thin because the ratio of the rate coefficients of the reactions O2+H→klOH+O, CH4+H→kllCH3+H2 (which describe the competition of oxygen and fuel for the H atom) is small. The small parameter δ = k1[O2]o(k11[CH4]u) scales the fuel concentration within this layer; the subscripts o and u on the concentrations identify conditions at the layer and in the unburnt mixture, respectively. Since reaction 11 is fast, the fuel depletes the radicals, causing the upstream layer to be radical-free and therefore chemically inert. By using the basic structure to provide the orders of magnitude of concentrations of all intermediates, the influences of additional reactions are estimated and added to the kinetic scheme. Numerical calculations of flame velocities at various pressures and preheat temperatures are performed, and the range of validity of the assumptions is discussed. The asymptotic structure identified here relies entirely on competition between rate coefficients; the relevant activation energies are not large. Nevertheless, effective overall activation energies can be identified from the results. These activation energies are calculated and employed in exploring the relationship between the present asymptotic structure and activation-energy asymptotics.},

  abstract = {We intend to close the gap between the numerical description of hydrocarbon flames using a large number of elementary reactions and the asymptotic description using very few reaction steps. To proceed in this direction we first reduce the hydrocarbon chemistry to the smallest number of steps that still provides a realistic flame structure. For the example of methane oxidation these are the four reaction steps CH4+2H+H2O=CO+4H2CH4+2H+H2O=CO+4H2CH\_4 + 2H + H\_2 O = CO + 4H\_2 (I)CO+H2O=CO2+H2CO+H2O=CO2+H2CO + H\_2 O = CO\_2 + H\_2 (II)2H+M=H2+M2H+M=H2+M2H + M = H\_2 + M (III)O2+3H2=2H+2H2OO2+3H2=2H+2H2OO\_2 + 3H\_2 = 2H + 2H\_2 O (IV) Their rates are algebraicly complicated expressions that contain kinetic data from 9 elementary reactions. If standard values for these data are used, the flame velocity of a stoichiometric methane-air flame is calculated as 45.6 cm/sec . The reaction rates maybe simplified to include only data from the five most important reactions CH4+H→CH3+H2CH4+OH→CH3+H2OCO+OH⇄CO2+HO2+H+M→HO2+MO2+H⇄OH+OCH4+H→CH3+H2CH4+OH→CH3+H2OCO+OH⇄CO2+HO2+H+M→HO2+MO2+H⇄OH+O\textbackslash begin\{gathered\}CH\_4 + H \textbackslash to CH\_3 + H\_2 \textbackslash hfill \textbackslash\textbackslash CH\_4 + OH \textbackslash to CH\_3 + H\_2 O \textbackslash hfill \textbackslash\textbackslash CO + OH \textbackslash rightleftarrows CO\_2 + H \textbackslash hfill \textbackslash\textbackslash O\_2 + H + M \textbackslash to HO\_2 + M \textbackslash hfill \textbackslash\textbackslash O\_2 + H \textbackslash rightleftarrows OH + O \textbackslash hfill \textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash end\{gathered\} where the rate expression of the fourth of these reactions is modified. This model is proposed for the asymptotic analysis of the flame structure.In the simplified model, reactions I, II and IV have a large activation energy while reaction III has zero activation energy. To develop an understanding of the flame structure that results from the four step model, first the structure of a steady plane premixed flame with one-step and two-step kinetics is discussed. Then the basic structure for the four step kinetics is derived.},

The material covers a wide range of model problems, both steady and unsteady, elaborating from advection-reaction and diffusion problems up to the Navier-Stokes equations and Friedrichs' systems. Both finite element and finite volume viewpoints are exploited to convey the main ideas underlying the design of the approximation. The analysis is presented in a rigorous mathematical setting where discrete counterparts of the key properties of the continuous problem are identified. The framework encompasses fairly general meshes regarding element shapes and hanging nodes. Salient implementation issues are also addressed.},

In this article, a detailed review of numerical models used to simulate evaporation of isolated droplets under several operating conditions is presented. This includes evaporation in high-pressure conditions, where real gas effects and solubility of ambient gas into the liquid droplet, come into play. Subsequently, a review of droplet combustion models, which are comprehensive enough to reveal the burning characteristics of an isolated droplet, is presented. Importance of liquid phase motion on evaporation and combustion behavior and water absorption in the case of alcohol droplets are reported.

This article reviews the advances made in the understanding of combustion dynamics and chemistry through experimental and numerical studies in counterflow non-premixed and partially premixed flames. Key contributions on fundamental aspects such as extinction, ignition and effect of perturbations on the stability of diffusion flames are first summarized and analysed. The review then focuses on the progress made in the understanding of the effect of inert particles and flame suppressants on the flame characteristics. A review of detailed studies on edge flames facilitates further understanding of local quenching and re-ignition phenomena in highly turbulent flames. The influence of radiation model and unsteady flow-conditions on the flame kinetics and dynamics along with work on NOx kinetics has been discussed. The review also outlines that specific experiments need to be carried out over a wide range of conditions for further understanding and validation of numerical models.},

  abstract = {This paper modifies the Burke-Schumann theory of diffusion flame size, so as to satisfy continuity when the mass velocity of the fuel gas is not constant. The resulting theory makes no assumptions about the reaction rate of fuel and oxidant, and so applies to flames with equilibrium-broadened reaction zones. The paper considers the flame height for circular, square, and long slot burners, but extension to other burner geometries is possible. The diffusion flame height of a circular port burner is found to be a special case. It is substantially independent of buoyancy forces and secondary air velocity. Thus any theory of jet diffusion flames must be tested on nonaxisymmetric burner geometries. For the slot burner, the diffusion flame height may be controlled by the momentum of the fuel jet or by buoyancy effects. The two conditions differ greatly, for instance in their sensitivity to burner slot width. The transition between buoyancy and momentum control is determined by a modified form of the Froude number. The paper also shows how the gas composition profiles may be calculated in the tail of the diffusion flame. The paper goes on to survey previous theories of diffusion flame size, and to compare them with the present work. Experimental verification of the theory given here will be presented in a second paper, which follows.},

  abstract = {This paper describes experiments to test the diffusion flame theory given in a previous paper. It is shown that diffusion flame sizes can be predicted for two different burner geometries (circular and slotted ports) by taking the diffusion coefficient of oxygen at a characteristic flame temperature of 1500 K. For the slot burner, the flame size is found to be controlled either by momentum or by buoyancy effects. The transition between the two regimes occurs, as predicted, when the modified Froude number is approximately one. In contrast, if the classical Burke-Schumann theory is used, the diffusion coefficient needed to predict the correct flame size varies by about a factor of six, depending upon the burner geometry and flame conditions. The paper goes on to show that gas compositions in the tail of a diffusion flame may be predicted by the theory already given. It also examines previous experimental work on diffusion flame size in relation to the present work.},

  abstract = {An interface-resolved simulation of the combustion of a fuel droplet suspended in normal gravity is presented in this work, followed by an extensive analysis on the physical aspects involved. The modeling is based on DropletSMOKE++, a multiphase solver developed for the modeling of droplet vaporization and combustion in convective conditions. A wide range of phenomena can be described by the model, including the interface advection, the phase-change, the combustion chemistry, non-ideal thermodynamics and multicomponent mixtures. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed simulation performed on this configuration, providing a useful theoretical and numerical support for the experimental activity on this field. A recent experimental work is used as a reference, in which a methanol droplet is suspended on a quartz fiber and ignited at different oxygen concentrations. The numerical analysis offers a detailed insight into the physics of the problem and a satisfactory agreement with the experiments in terms of diameter decay, radial temperature profiles and sensitivity to the oxygen concentration. The vaporization rate is affected by the thermal conduction from the fiber, due to the high temperatures involved. Moreover, the fiber perturbs the flame itself, providing quenching at its surface. The combustion physics is compared to the one predicted at zero-gravity, evidencing a lower standoff-ratio, a higher flame temperature and an intense internal circulation. The distribution of the species around the droplet shows (i) a local accumulation of intermediate oxidation products at the fiber surface and (ii) water absorption in the liquid phase, affecting the vaporization rate.},

The method has been implemented in an efficient FFT-based two-fluid Navier-Stokes solver, using an algebraic VoF method for the interface representation, and extended with the transport equations of thermal energy and vaporized liquid mass for the single-component evaporating liquid in an inert gas. The conservation of vaporizing liquid and computation of the interfacial mass flux are performed with the aid of a reconstructed signed-distance field, which enables the use of well-established methods for phase change solvers based on level-set methods. The interface velocity is computed with a novel approach that ensures accurate mass conservation, by constructing a divergence-free extension of the liquid velocity field onto the entire domain. The resulting approach does not depend on the type of interface reconstruction (i.e. can be employed in both algebraic and geometrical VoF methods). We extensively verified and validated the overall method against several benchmark cases, and demonstrated its excellent mass conservation and good overall performance for simulating evaporating two-fluid flows in two and three dimensions.},

The method aims at minimizing cache conflicts and interprocessor communication costs and, at the same time, maximizing processor load balance and Level-3 BLAS performance. The synchronization events are reduced by one order of magnitude compared with a one-level scheduling strategy. This results in an efficient parallel sparse LU decomposition method.

  abstract = {We present a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows using triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax–Friedrichs fluxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk−Pk) and mixed-order (Pk−Pk−1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more efficient method, characterized by a compact stencil size. We show the temporal and spatial behavior of the method by solving some popular benchmarking tests. For an unsteady Stokes problem, second-order temporal convergence is obtained, while for the Taylor vortex test problem on both semi-structured and fully unstructured triangular meshes, spectral convergence with respect to the polynomial degree k is obtained. By studying the Orr–Sommerfeld stability problem, we demonstrate that the Pk−Pk method yields a stable solution, while the Pk−Pk−1 formulation leads to unphysical instability. The good performance of the method is further shown by simulating vortex shedding in flow past a square cylinder. We conclude that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin method with the Pk−Pk formulation is an efficient scheme for accurate and stable solution of the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows.},

Three MMS problems relevant to combustion applications are presented and tested on a variety of structured and unstructured grids. Several issues are investigated, including the use of tabulated state properties (i.e., density) and the effect of sub-iterations in the time-advancement method. The MMS implementations provide a quantitative framework to evaluate the impact of these practices on the code’s convergence and order-of-accuracy. Simulation results show that linear interpolation of the equation-of-state causes numerical fluctuations that impede convergence and reduce accuracy. Likewise, the sub-iterative time-advancement scheme requires a significant number of outer iterations to subdue splitting errors in highly nonlinear combustion problems. These findings highlight the importance of careful code and solution verification in the simulation of variable-density flows.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in the development of computational algorithms, reaction kinetics, and mainframe supercomputers have enabled the combustion scientist to investigate chemically reacting systems that were computationally infeasible only a few years ago. In particular, the coupling of adaptive numerical methods with large memory parallel/vector computers has produced an extremely powerful tool with which to probe flame structure. The difficulties in solving high heat release combustion problems, such as flames, center on the large number of equations that must be solved for the elementary chemical species, the exponential nonlinearities that occur in the governing partial differential equations, and the disparate length scales that must be resolved in the computed solution. In this paper we investigate numerically one such reacting system—the axisymmetric laminar diffusion flame. Such flames are important in the interaction of heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions in gas turbines and commercial burners. The ability to predict the coupled effects of complex transport phenomena with detailed chemical kinetics in these flames is critical in modeling turbulent reacting flows, in improving engine efficiency, and in understanding the processes by which pollutants are formed. In our study we consider an unconfined configuration in which a cylindrical fuel stream is surrounded by a coflowing oxidizer jet. Computationally, we solve the governing conservation equations of mass, momentum, species balance, and energy with detailed transport and finite rate chemistry submodels. A discrete solution is obtained on a two-dimensional grid by employing Newton's method with adaptive mesh refinement. Unlike some models in which diffusion in the axial direction is neglected, we consider the fully elliptic problem. The computations are performed in parallel using up to six processors of an IBM ES/3090 600J. The study undertaken in this paper represents the first time that hydrocarbon chemistry with two carbon atoms has been modeled in an elliptic formulation of a laminar flame. The results of this investigation can enable the combustion scientist to probe the fluid dynamics-thermochemistry interaction and its effect on the structure of coflowing methane-air diffusion flames. The study also illustrates the applicability of partial equilibrium/full equilibrium chemistry approximations in diffusion flames and provides an assessment of the use of mole fraction versus mixture fraction correlations for flamelet models of turbulent combustion.},

The two-dimensional flame shape model is based on an extension of the classical buoyancy-controlled flame height model of Roper. The derivation of the model is presented along with the simplifying assumptions. In the buoyancy-controlled regime, the flame height is known to be a function of the gravitational acceleration and, thus, the theoretical results are compared to experimental data at different gravitational levels. Despite its simplicity, results from the model showed good agreement with the experimental data. By employing a simplified description of flame behavior, a more tractable representation of the physical transport mechanisms responsible for the experimentally observed behavior is obtained.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations including detailed chemical and physical models are performed to investigate the influence of different physical parameters on the auto-ignition of n-heptane/iso-octane droplets in air. Simulations are performed for isobaric conditions with an ambient pressure of 8bar and a droplet radius of 200μm. The ambient gas temperature ranges from 800K to 2000K and the droplet temperature was varied from 300K to 400K. Below an ambient temperature of 1000K the ignition delay time is found to increase with an increasing volume fraction of iso-octane. Above 1000K the ignition delay time appears to be almost independent of the mixture composition of the droplet. The local ignition conditions are also studied. It turns out that ignition occurs at points, where the mixture is lean. This trend is more significant, if the ambient temperature increases. The influence of physical properties of the mixture components, like diffusion coefficients, heat conductivity, heat of vaporization and vapor pressure, is investigated. Furthermore, the influences of simplifying assumptions such as the distillation and diffusion limit are studied.},

The ambient gas temperature turns out to be the physical parameter with the largest influence on the ignition delay time. With increasing ambient temperature the ignition delay time decreases. Furthermore, the ignition delay time decreases with increasing pressure following a power law. Two dimensional simulations show the almost exponential dependence of the ignition delay time on the velocity of a gas counterfiow. If the counterfiow is too strong, the flame is extinguished. Furthermore, the location of ignition is strongly affected by the counterfiow velocity.},

  abstract = {The structural response of counterflowing methane/oxygen/nitrogen diffusion flames to aerodynamic straining was experimentally and computationally investigated. The temperature and major species concentration profiles were experimentally determined as functions of the applied strain rate by using spontaneous Raman scattering. The experimental situations were further computationally simulated with detailed reaction mechanisms and transport properties. The computed results were found to be in close quantitative agreement with the experimental data. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to counterflow premixed flames, a strained, counterflow diffusion flame has less flexibility to freely adjust its location in response to strain rate variations such that its structure in the direction normal to the flame surface is quite sensitive to variations in the strain rate. Specifically, the counterflow diffusion flame becomes thinner with increasing strain rate a, with its thickness varying inversely with √a. This leads to increased amount of reactant leakage, progressive reduction in the flame temperature, and eventually extinction of the flame. Computational results further show that while the heat release rate of premixed flames is characterized by a single sharp maximum, for diffusion flames a secondary maximum described by a distinctively different reaction submechanism exists on the oxidizer side of the primary heat release zone. The nature and extent of the negative heat release rate on the fuel side of the flame, as well as its relation to the presence of a dent around the same location on the temperature profile as observed in previous experiments, were also discussed.},

Emphasis is put on vaporization, where numerical difficulties arise in imposing accurate jump conditions for heat and mass transfers. We use both the Level Set Method and the Ghost Fluid Method to capture the interface motion accurately and to handle suitable jump conditions. A local vaporization mass flow rate per unit of surface area is defined and Stefan flow is involved in the process. Specific care has been devoted to the extension of discontinuous variables across the interface to populate ghost cells, in order to avoid parasitic currents and numerical diffusion across the interface. A projection method is set up to impose both the velocity field continuity and a divergence-free condition for the extended velocity field across the interface. The d2 law is verified in the numerical simulations of the vaporization of an isolated static drop. Results are then presented for a water droplet moving in air. Vapor mass fraction and temperature fields inside and outside the droplet are presented.},

The predictive ability and accuracy of the code was tested by applying it to the prediction of a confined methane/air laminar diffusion flame and comparing its predictions with other numerical study and experimental data available in the literature. The predicted velocity, temperature and major species concentrations were found to be in reasonably good agreement with other numerical results and measurements. Execution times resulting from the use of several ordinary differential equation solvers in the code were examined and ROWMAP was found to be superior. A static load balancing strategy was used to improve the performance of the parallel code. A comparison of speed-ups and efficiencies for the runs with and without load balancing showed a considerable decrease in the central processing unit time of the parallel code when load balancing was performed. Finally, the predictive ability of the code for transient combustion was presented.},

The models presented here remove on one hand, acoustic wave propagation while retaining the compressibilty effects resulting from combustion and on the other hand, simplify the integro-differential equation for radiative transfer to a set of differential equations independent of the angle variable and compatible to those used for modelling flow and combustion. We briefly discuss the basic discretization methodology for the combined equations and its implementation in a modified projection method. We present validation computations for a two-dimensional methane/air flame in which the computational results are compared for nongray participating media.},

This paper reviews experimental studies of these counterflow diffusion flames and presents a detailed summary of our present understanding of them. The paper begins by classifying these laminar counterflow diffusion flames into four types: (I) the counterflow diffusion flame between two opposed jets, (II) the flat, counterflow diffusion flame between two opposed matrix burners, (III) the counterflow diffusion flame in the forward stagnation region of a spherical or hemispherical porous burner, and (IV) the counterflow diffusion flame in the forward stagnation region of a cylindrical porous burner. Next, the characteristics of these counterflow diffusion flames are presented, and these flames are then shown as being suitable for a fundamental study of diffusion flame and its combustion characteristics, especially, (1) for a detailed study of the structure of a laminar diffusion flame and of high-temperature flame kinetics, (2) for an accurate study of combustion characteristics closely related to flame-extinction phenomena (e.g. dilution limits of diffusion flames, the overall reaction rates for fuel-oxidant combinations, and the effectiveness of inhibitors), and (3) for a careful study of the various properties of a flame in an electric field.},

  abstract = {Non-premixed turbulent combustion processes control most practical applications of combustion. Studying these mechanisms has been the objective of numerous theoretical and experimental works in the last century. In the past 10 years, direct numerical simulation (DNS) has emerged as a new methodology. It has become an essential tool to understand and model turbulent combustion. DNS numerically solves the set of equations describing turbulent flames by resolving all chemical and flow scales. Because formulated assumptions can be tested accurately, the resulting data provide unique information to build turbulent combustion models. This review first discusses the fundamental properties of laminar diffusion flames. It then presents various DNS results to illustrate the different problems that can be studied using this tool. These problems include validity of the modeling hypothesis, topology of flame surfaces, and ignition and extinction mechanisms. The review also discusses the different analysis techniques employed to extract information from DNS and explores the limits of these methods.},

The temperature differences between the hot and cold walls are large. Neither Boussinesq nor low-Mach number approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations are used. The ideal-gas law is used and the viscosity is given by Sutherland’s law. A constant Prandtl number is assumed. The computational method is completely described by Vierendeels et al.

  abstract = {The planar laminar flow resulting from the impingement of two gaseous jets of different density issuing into an open space from aligned steadily fed slot nozzles of semi-width  HH  separated by a distance  2L2L  is investigated by numerical and analytical methods. Specific consideration is given to the high Reynolds and low Mach number conditions typically present in counterflow-flame experiments, for which the flow is nearly inviscid and incompressible. It is shown that introduction of a density-weighted vorticity–streamfunction formulation effectively reduces the problem to one involving two jets of equal density, thereby removing the vortex-sheet character of the interface separating the two jet streams. Besides the geometric parameter  L/HL/H , the solution depends only on the shape of the velocity profiles in the feed streams and on the jet momentum-flux ratio. While conformal mapping can be used to determine the potential solution corresponding to uniform velocity profiles, numerical integration is required in general to compute rotational flows, including those arising with Poiseuille velocity profiles, with simplified solutions found in the limits  L/H≪1L/H\textbackslash ll 1  and  L/H≫1L/H\textbackslash gg 1 . The results are used to quantify the near-stagnation-point region, of interest in counterflow-flame studies, including the local value of the strain rate as well as the curvature of the separating interface and the variations of the strain rate away from the stagnation point.},

A computer program of FORTRAN code is used to solve the governing equations according to finite volume method. The effects of the Reynolds number and expansion ratio on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are investigated. The size of the primary recirculation zone increases with the reduction of expansion ratio and the fluctuation of isotherms increased with the increase of Reynolds number. The periodic characteristics and the dissimilarity between Nu and Cf appear in the transitional flow regime. The rotating fluids in the reattachment region increase the flow instability and the interchange of the hot and cold fluids increases heat transfer instability. The combined effects of flow instability and heat transfer instability play an important role in the formation of the dissimilarity between Nu and Cf.}

The Newton equations are solved by a block-line tridiagonal method.

The algorithm can be applied t o problems ranging from non-reacting flows t o reacting flows in two- or three-dimensional configurations. In the unconfined case, the lifted flame and the "triple flame" are both predicted in the numerical solution. The computed solutions agree well with the experimental rcsulls.
