The following sections present a comprehensive solver validation using various test cases. In \cref{sec:SingleCompIsotCase} the applicability of the solver is analyzed for isothermal single-component systems. Later in \cref{sec:SinCompNonIsothermCase} several single-component non-isothermal configurations are studied. Finally, in \cref{sec:MultCompNonIsothermCase} test cases for multicomponent non-isothermal systems are presented, with a particular emphasis on systems where combustion is present.
%Additionally the convergence properties of the DG-method will be analyzed for some of the systems.

All calculations shown here were performed on an AMD EPYC 7543 32-core Processor, DDR4 %TODO \todo[inline]{which specifications of the cluster should i include?}
Unless otherwise stated, all calculations use the termination criteria presented in \cref{ssec:TerminationCriterion}.
Some of the results presented in the next sections has been published \citep{gutierrez-jorqueraFullyCoupledHighorder2022}.

\section{Single-component isothermal cases}\label{sec:SingleCompIsotCase}
%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%
The solver presented in the previous chapter is initially validated for single-component isothermal cases. In these cases, only the continuity and momentum equations are used and solved. The energy equation and the species concentration equations are replaced by the conditions $T = 1.0$ and $Y_0 = 1.0$ in the whole domain. This means that the physical properties of the flow (density and viscosity) are constant and that the flow is fully incompressible because the density does not show a thermodynamic or hydrodynamic dependence.

\section{Single-component non-isothermal cases} \label{sec:SinCompNonIsothermCase}
%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%
For the test cases presented in this section, the equations for continuity, momentum and energy are solved. All systems are assumed to be single-component, thus $N = 1$ and $Y_0 = 1.0$. We start by showing in \cref{ssec:HeatedBackwardFacingStep} an extension of the backward-facing step configuration presented in the last section, considering now a non-isothermal system. Later in \cref{ssec:CouetteFlowTempDiff} a Couette flow configuration that presents a temperature gradient in the vertical direction is studied. Finally, in \cref{ss:DHC} a heated square cavity configuration is studied to assess the solver's ability to simulate flows of variable density in closed systems.

In this section, test cases for combustion applications will be shown. For all the cases treated here, the solution of the flame sheet problem described in \cref{ssec:FlameSheet} is calculated first. Subsequently, this solution is used as an initial estimate for the solution of the finite chemistry rate problem (c.f. \cref{ssec:NonDimLowMachEquations}). In \cref{ssec:coflowFlame} a co-flow laminar diffusion flame configuration is calculated and some remarks about the convergence of the solving algorithm of the XNSEC-solver using this case are done. Next in \cref{ss:CDF} a diffusion flame in a counterflow configuration is simulated and validated by comparing it with results from a one-dimensional configuration. Finally in \cref{ss:UDF} a pseudo-one-dimensional diffusion flame configuration is used to show the convergence ratios of the fully coupled solver. In all the test cases presented in this section, a smoothing parameter $\sigma = 0.02$ was used (cf. \cref{ssec:FlameSheet}). Furthermore, methane combustion according to the one-step model shown in \cref{sec:ChemModel} is considered, therefore, the relevant chemical components are \ch{CH4}, \ch{O2}, \ch{CO2}, \ch{H2O} and \ch{N2}, thus $N = 5$ and $\vec{Y}' = \left(Y_{\ch{CH4}},Y_{\ch{O2}},Y_{\ch{CO2}},Y_{\ch{H2O}}\right)$. The nitrogen mass fraction $Y_{\ch{N2}}$ is calculated according to \cref{eq:MassFractionConstraint}.
