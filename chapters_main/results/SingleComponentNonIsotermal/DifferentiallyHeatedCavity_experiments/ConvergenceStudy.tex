\subsubsection{Convergence study}\label{ssec:ConvStudyHeatedCavity}
An $h-$convergence study of the differentially heated cavity configuration was conducted. Calculations were performed for polynomial degrees $k = {1,2,3,4}$ and equidistant regular meshes with, respectively, $8, 16, 32, 64, 128$ and $256$ elements in each spatial coordinate.  The $L^2$-Norm was used for the calculation of the errors against the solution in the finest mesh. The results of the $h$-convergence study for varying polynomial orders $k$ are shown in \cref{fig:ConvergenceDHC}. Recall that, for increasing polynomial order, the expected order of convergence is given by the slope of the line curve when cell length and errors are presented in a log-log plot. Because we are using a mixed order formulation, the slopes should be equal to $k$ for the pressure and equal to $k+1$ for all other variables.  It is observed how the convergence rates scale approximately as $k+1$. Interestingly, for $k=2$ the rates are higher than expected. On the other hand, some degeneration in the convergence rates is observed for $k = 4$.

As discussed in the previous section, the difference in the average values of the Nusselt number on the hot wall $\text{Nu}_\text{h}$  and the cold wall $\text{Nu}_\text{c}$ is a direct consequence of the spatial discretization error.

In \cref{fig:NusseltStudy} the convergence behavior of the Nusselt number for different polynomial degrees $k$, different number of elements and for two different Ra numbers is presented. As expected, it can be observed that this discrepancy is smaller when a larger number of elements is used.
