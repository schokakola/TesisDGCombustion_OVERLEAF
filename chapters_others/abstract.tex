Fully coupled.
High order.
Low Mach flow numbers with moderate to high temperature differences. 
One step chemical model with variable kinetic properties.
Globalized newton algorithm.
Implicit timesteping using BDF-schemes. 


Steady state combustion systems are initialized by flame-sheet estimates, which correspond to the solution of a system with infinitely fast chemistry. 
Homotopy methods for highly non-linear systems.
Adaptive mesh refinement.
