Fully coupled.
High order.
Low Mach flow numbers with moderate to high temperature differences. 
One step chemical model with variable kinetic properties.
Globalized Newton algorithm.
Implicit timesteping using BDF-schemes. 


Steady state combustion systems are initialized by flame-sheet estimates, which correspond to the solution of a system with infinitely fast chemistry.
